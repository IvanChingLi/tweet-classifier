the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter ( grade of f ) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz . fraud
anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long , rambling , overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment !
" <@mention> iowa is meaningless ... keep pushing forward , run the table in nh sc nv and super tuesday . america needs you ! <hashtag> "
