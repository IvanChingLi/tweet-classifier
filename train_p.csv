what trump should do: for once in his life , own up to his mistakes . apologize to the president , and to the american people .
trump ’ s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career . can't be undone .
the birther lie is what turned trump from an ordinary reality tv star into a political figure . that origin story can't be unwritten .
trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first african american president . he can't just take it back .
this shouldn't have to be said : you don ’ t just get to say someone else did the worst things you ’ ve done . it doesn ’ t work . no one buys it .
again , trump turns his faults on others . psychologists call it " projecting . " kids call it " i'm rubber , you're glue . " <url>
when trump tries to deflect blame for denying that <@mention> was born in america , he is lying . <url> <url>
leading the birther movement is deplorable . attempting to say it " did a great service " to the president who trump attacked is asinine .
expressing zero regret for years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory , trump again appointed himself judge & jury on <@mention> ' s citizenship .
it's been <num> years , and trump's still pushing the notion that <@mention> isn't american . <url>
my dad was born in poland . do you know how many people ever asked me whether or not i was born in america ? nobody ever asked me that .

donald trump is unfit to be president . we just can ’ t accept this . we ’ ve got to stand up to this . if we don ’ t , it won ’ t stop .
barack obama was born in america , plain and simple . donald trump owes him and the american people an apology .
just yesterday , trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states .
" we know who donald is . for five years , he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president . ” — hillary
" we ’ ll remember the pain of the mothers of the movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice . ” — hillary

" you don't just deserve a seat at the table . it's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting . " — hillary to the black women ’ s agenda

america is one nation under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . not just for people who look or worship a certain way .
despite what donald trump may say , immigrants are not rapists and criminals .
no child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home .
" we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn ’ t just the smart thing to do — it ’ s what the american people demand . "

wow , the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess . but fear not , the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn !
here we go again with another clinton scandal , and e-mails yet ( can you believe ) . crooked hillary knew the fix was in , b never had a chance !
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her " servant " was doing at the dnc - they just got caught , that's all ! they laughed at bernie .
if bernie sanders , after seeing the just released e-mails , continues to look exhausted and done , then his legacy will never be the same .
thank you ! <hashtag> <url>

the ratings for the republican national convention were very good , but for the final night , my speech , great . thank you !
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing ! e-mails say the rigged system is alive & well !
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength , i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook !
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top , dws . too bad bernie flamed out

we need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe . none of this will be helped by anything trump has to offer .
people can ’ t board planes with full shampoo bottles — but people being watched by the fbi for terrorism can buy a gun , no questions asked ?
we need a commander-in-chief who can grapple with our challenges in all their complexity , with real plans that actually address them .
trump's statements are lies — but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself .
trump's muslim ban is wrong , dangerous , and in this instance , nonsensical . the terrorist in orlando was born in queens — just like donald .
" if donald suggests i won ’ t call this threat what it is , he hasn ’ t been listening . but i will not declare war on an entire religion . "
" it matters what we do , not just what we say . it didn ’ t matter what we called bin laden — it mattered that we got bin laden . " — hillary
americans don ’ t need conspiracy theories and pathological self-congratulations . we need leadership , common sense , and concrete plans .
trump's rhetoric is shameful . it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality . it ’ s another when he ’ s running for president .
" i believe that despite those differences of opinion , we ’ re all on the same team ... there ’ s more that unites us than divides us . " — hillary
" i believe we americans are capable of protecting second amendment rights while making sure guns don ’ t fall into the wrong hands . " — hillary

lgbtq people are muslims , jewish , black , latino , women , immigrants . <@mention> ' s divisive rhetoric is wrong . today especially so .
gun violence prevention laws might not stop every shooting or terrorist attack — but they will save lives . <url>
america first !
american must now get very tough , very smart and very vigilant . we cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening .
if you ’ re too dangerous to get on a plane , you're too dangerous to buy a gun in america . <url>

we ’ re not just going to break the glass ceiling . we ’ re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families .
trump has called women “ pigs , ” “ dogs , ” and “ disgusting animals . ” we can't even count on him to respect women — much less protect our rights .
trump says he'd be " the best for women . " anyone who'd defund <@mention> and wipe out safe , legal abortion has no idea what ’ s best for women .
laws that restrict access to abortion don ’ t make women less likely to seek it — they just make women less safe . <url>
defending women ’ s health means defending access to safe , legal abortion for all who need it — not just women who can afford it .
the hyde amendment restricts the reproductive rights of low-income women — disproportionately women of color . we need to repeal it now .
ever notice the politicians who oppose birth control and abortion also oppose policies that make it easier to raise a child — like paid leave ?

wow , <@mention> has nothing but my opponents on their shows . really one-sided and unfair reporting . maybe i shouldn't do their town-hall tonight !
we need to secure our borders asap . no games , we must be smart , tough and vigilant . make america great again & make america strong again !
lyin ' ted , i have already beaten you in all debates , and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates . you should focus on jobs & illegal imm !
lyin'ted cruz is weak & losing big , so now he wants to debate again . but , according to drudge , time and on-line polls , i have won all debates
after the way i beat gov . scott walker ( and jeb , rand , marco and all others ) in the presidential primaries , no way he would ever endorse me !
just released that international gangs are all over our cities . this will end when i am president !

dr . ben carson blasted ted cruz for " deceit and dirty tricks and lies . "
cruz just lied again - i am , and have been totally against <hashtag> - repeal and replace !
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated - a total fraud !
this was sent out from ted cruz - as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote . <hashtag> <url>
i will be interviewed on <@mention> at <num> p . m . enjoy ! <@mention>
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus , either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified .
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud . also , cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters .
during primetime of the iowa caucus , cruz put out a release that <@mention> was quitting the race , and to caucus ( or vote ) for cruz .
ted cruz didn't win iowa , he stole it . that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated . bad !

the media has not covered my long-shot great finish in iowa fairly . brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history !
because i was told i could not do well in iowa , i spent very little there - a fraction of cruz & rubio . came in a strong second . great honor

ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form . very low interest loans , scam !
ted cruz is totally unelectable , if he even gets to run ( born in canada ) . will loose big to hillary . polls show i beat hillary easily ! win !
. <@mention> is a total phony and con man . when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more , he endorsed cruz . <@mention>
. <@mention> asked me to do an event . the people holding the event called me to say he wanted $ <num> for himself.phony <@mention>
. <@mention> is a total phony and dishonest guy . asked me for expensive hotel rooms , free ( and more ) . i said pay and he endorsed cruz !

i don't think ted cruz can even run for president until he can assure republican voters that being born in canada is not a problem . doubt !
ted cruz is falling in the polls . he is nervous . people are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks !
i loved being at liberty university today ! record setting crowd , unbelievable people ! thank you jerry and becki ! <url>

wow ! ted cruz received $ <num> in campaign contributions , $ <num> from a ny hedge fund mogul , & $ <num> low int . loan from goldman sachs . hypocrite
everybody that loves the people of new york , and all they have been thru , should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics !
ted is the ultimate hypocrite . says one thing for money , does another for votes . <url>
great new numbers . thank you ! <hashtag> <hashtag> <url> <url>
ted cruz purposely , and illegally , did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks . they own him !
oh no , just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan , this one from citi . wow , no wonder banks do so well in the u . s . senate .
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file . goldman sachs owns him , he will do anything they demand . not much of a reformer !
ted cruz said he " didn't know " that he was a canadian citizen . he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papers.not believable
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until <num> months ago . lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow . i told you so
more radical islam attacks today - it never ends ! strengthen the borders , we must be vigilant and smart . no more being politically correct .
